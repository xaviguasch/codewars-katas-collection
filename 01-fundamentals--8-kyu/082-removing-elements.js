// Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

// Example:

// ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
// None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

const removeEveryOther = (arr) => arr.filter((el, i) => i % 2 === 0)
