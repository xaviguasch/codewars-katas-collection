I'm new to coding and now I want to get the sum of two arrays...actually the sum of all their elements. I'll appreciate for your help.

P.S. Each array includes only integer numbers. Output is a number too.


const arrayPlusArray = (arr1, arr2) => {
  return arr1 +arr2
}


console.log(arrayPlusArray([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]));
console.log(arrayPlusArray([-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]));
console.log(arrayPlusArray([0, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6]));
