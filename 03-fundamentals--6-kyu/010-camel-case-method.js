// Write simple .camelCase method (camel_case function in PHP, CamelCase in C# or camelCase in Java) for strings. All words must have their first letter capitalized without spaces.

// For instance:

// "hello case".camelCase() => HelloCase
// "camel case word".camelCase() => CamelCaseWord

String.prototype.camelCase = function () {
  //your code here
}

console.log('test case'.camelCase())
console.log('camel case method'.camelCase())
console.log('say hello'.camelCase())
console.log(''.camelCase())
