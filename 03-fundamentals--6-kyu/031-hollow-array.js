// DESCRIPTION:
// An array is said to be hollow if it contains 3 or more 0s in the middle that are preceded and followed by the same number of non-zero elements. Furthermore, all the zeroes in the array must be in the middle of the array.

// Write a function named isHollow/is_hollow/IsHollow that accepts an integer array and returns true if it is a hollow array,else false.

const isHollow = (x) => {
  return
}

console.log(isHollow([-1, 0, 0, 0, 3]))
console.log(isHollow([1, 0, 0, 0, 0]))
console.log(isHollow([100, 0, 0, 3]))
