// DESCRIPTION:
// Sort array by last character

// Complete the function to sort a given array or list by last character of elements.

// Element can be an integer or a string.

// Example:
// ['acvd', 'bcc']  -->  ['bcc', 'acvd']
// The last characters of the strings are d and c. As c comes before d, sorting by last character will give ['bcc', 'acvd'].

// If two elements don't differ in the last character, then they should be sorted by the order they come in the array.

const sortMe = (arr) => {
  return
}

console.log(sortMe(['acvd', 'bcc']))
console.log(sortMe(['14', '13']))
console.log(sortMe(['asdf', 'asdf', '14', '13']))
console.log(sortMe(['bsde', 'asdf', 14, '13']))
console.log(sortMe(['asdf', 14, '13', 'asdf']))
console.log(sortMe(['xxxf', 'aaaf', 'kf', 'f', 'ooooof']))
